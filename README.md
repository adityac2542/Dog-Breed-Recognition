# Dog-Breed-Recognition
Uses Neural network for deep learning and predicting the breed of the dog

## Model used:
- mobilenet_v2_130_224
- Which is already trained on 1 Million+ images

## Process:
- Performed the First EDA on the dataset.
- Seperated the labels and the images
- Image processing (Resizing them into consumable size)
- Dividing them into a batch of 32(for processing).

## Build the model
- Set up the intial template of the model(using keras).
- Created callbacks for loggings and monitoring.

## Train the model
- Trained the model on 1000 images to check if the model is working
- After testing the working and resolving the errors
- Trained on whole training images.
- Achieved the Accuracy of 99%

## Implementation
- Implemented the model into an app which recognizes the breed of the dogs.
